## WooCommerce Square Helper

### What's this?

At present the Square Helper tool has these functions:

1. Manually sync a single product or variation's inventory with Square. 
1. Update sync limits.
1. Kicker!

It is set up to be able to add more functionality when needed. 

### How do these help?

1. Sometimes sites break, and this can fix the inventory of single items at a time, if needed. 
1. If a site is timing out, this makes it possible to lower (or raise) the limits on what's queried from Square at a time. Values are saved in the database, then applied via filters. 
1. The kicker sets up a schedled action to kick the sync if it has gotten stuck.

## Setup

1. Install the plugin.
1. Go to Tools > Square Helper.

### Notes

There should be a zip file in this repo, make sure the version number matches what's in the code.
